## Accessing the Canonicalized Dataset
MediTOD uses UMLS vocabularies to canonicalize the labels. To use the canonicalized dataset, please follow these steps:

1. **Obtain a UMLS License**:  
   Access to the dataset requires a UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) license. You can apply through the [National Library of Medicineâ€™s UMLS website](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/umls.html).

2. **Request the Dataset**:  
   Once you have acquired the UMLS license, kindly fill out the required form to request access to the dataset.
